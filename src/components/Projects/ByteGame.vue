          For this project, I designed and developed a game from the ground up, focusing on both
          creative & technical aspects. The project was structured around multiple milestones,
          allowing for iterative development and refinement over the course of a semester.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to building the game, I delivered several presentations including a project
          pitch, midterm update, final presentation. After the class concluded, all students had to
          present their game at Qualcon 2024, where I demoed my game to attendees and voting board,
          where I had to communicate my design choices, development process, and overall vision.

          BYTE went on to win <span class="font-bold">People's Choice</span> and
          <span class="font-bold"> Game of the Year â€” Runner Up </span>

          BYTE is a precision-based puzzle-platformer where you try to escape a realm controlled by
          an artificial intelligent being. Every asset in BYTE was hand-drawn by me, with 8 distinct
          levels, a succint story with overarching themes of relfection, perservearance, and
          embracing challenges.
        </p>
        <p>While BYTE isn't public, you can get a glimpse of the game through the images below.</p>
