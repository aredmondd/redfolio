      For this project, I designed and developed a game from the ground up, focusing on both
      creative & technical aspects. The project was structured around multiple milestones, allowing
      for iterative development and refinement over the course of a semester.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to building the game, I delivered several presentations including a project pitch,
      midterm update, final presentation. After the class concluded, all students had to present
      their game at Qualcon 2024, where I demoed my game to attendees and voting board, where I had
      to communicate my design choices, development process, and overall vision.

      BYTE went on to win <span class="font-bold">People's Choice</span> and
      <span class="font-bold"> Game of the Year â€” Runner Up </span>

      BYTE is a precision-based puzzle-platformer where you try to escape a realm controlled by an
      artificial intelligent being. Every asset in BYTE was hand-drawn by me, with 8 distinct
      levels, a succint story with overarching themes of relfection, perservearance, and embracing
      challenges.

    <p>While BYTE isn't public, you can get a glimpse of the game through the images below.</p>
