      This project focused on designing a 16-page magazine, emphasizing layout, typography, and
      imagery. Each student was tasked with:
    </p>

    <div>
      <span class="font-mono font-light">1.</span> Creating a unique magazine concept and name
      <br />
      <span class="font-mono font-light">2.</span> Designing 3 distinct covers and presenting them,
      eventually picking the best one <br />
      <span class="font-mono font-light">3.</span> Creating a table of contents (1 spread) with the
      main articles <br />
      <span class="font-mono font-light">4.</span> Laying out multi-page spreads for the main
      articles
      <br />
      <span class="font-mono font-light">5.</span> Designing an ad for the back of the magazine
    </div>

    <p>
      The goal was to develop a strong design hierarchy, utilize a grid system for layout
      consistency, and ensure clear legibility with effective typography. The final designs were
      printed on paper and presented to the class.

      With the recent release of the Nike Alphafly 3, I saw this assignment as the perfect
      opportunity to create a magazine centered on the world of running. My goal was to create a
      sleek, fast, and visually striking experience that would capture the energy and innovation of
      modern racing shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      To achieve this, I used a bold, vibrant orange as my primary color—directly pulled from the
      Alphafly 3—to evoke speed, intensity, and excitement. I also incorporated a futuristic,
      space-themed aesthetic, drawing parallels between cutting-edge shoe technology and pushing
      human performance beyond limits. Every design choice from typography to the layout was made to
      reflect the forward-thinking of elite running, and specifically, the Nike Alphafly 3.
